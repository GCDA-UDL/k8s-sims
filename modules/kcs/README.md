# kcs — pfn k8s-cluster-simulator module

[`pfnet-research/k8s-cluster-simulator`](https://github.com/pfnet-research/k8s-cluster-simulator)
is Preferred Networks' **discrete-event** Kubernetes scheduler simulator. Unlike
the kube-scheduler-based modules (kube-sched, kwok) it models pod **execution
over simulated time** — each pod runs for a configurable duration and then frees
its resources — so a scheduler is evaluated against a *temporal* workload, very
cheaply (no containers, no API server).

It complements the existing simulators: kube-sched/kwok test placement on a live
(fake) control plane; k8ssim covers Volcano; kcs adds a pure event-driven
scheduler simulator with a programmable workload timeline.

## Reproducible build (pinned)

- Upstream: `https://github.com/pfnet-research/k8s-cluster-simulator`
- **Pinned commit: `55e4108275b4704bc35dfc4eb4774f6d1be597c3`** (2019-04-15)
- GOPATH-era project (no `go.mod`; `dep` + **vendored** deps) → build in legacy mode.

```sh
bash modules/kcs/build.sh           # -> modules/kcs/kcs-yamlsim
# or manually:
#   clone @ 55e4108, copy modules/kcs/sim/{main,submitter}.go into cmd/yamlsim/,
#   GO111MODULE=off go build -o kcs-yamlsim ./cmd/yamlsim
```

Verified build: Go 1.24.4, GOPATH mode, ~13 s, 37 MB binary. Not committed
(build from source). Resolution order: `$K8S_CLUSTER_SIM_BIN` →
`modules/kcs/kcs-yamlsim` → `/usr/local/bin/kcs-yamlsim` → `/tmp/kcs-yamlsim`.

## Custom entry point

The upstream `example` hard-codes a random workload in Go. `modules/kcs/sim/`
replaces it with:
- **`submitter.go`** — reads the toolkit's standard `pods-<N>.yaml` (Alibaba k8s
  Pods) and submits each once, synthesising the `simSpec` annotation the
  simulator needs (one phase of `--duration` seconds at the pod's requested
  cpu/memory/`nvidia.com/gpu`; the Alibaba `alibabacloud.com/gpu-count`
  annotation becomes `nvidia.com/gpu`). Then it terminates so `Run` returns.
- **`main.go`** — wires a `GenericScheduler` (GeneralPredicates +
  BalancedResourceAllocation + LeastRequested) with the YAML submitter; flags
  `--config`, `--pods`, `--duration`.

## How it runs (no new dataset needed)

kcs reuses the **standard** `data/<size>/vanilla` datasets directly:
- `nodes-<N>.yaml` → `kcs_config.py` generates the pfn `config.yaml` (k8s Node
  resources pass through verbatim; GPU annotation → `nvidia.com/gpu`).
- `pods-<N>.yaml` → the workload.

Integration mirrors `opensim`/`k8ssim`: the binary runs inside the `/sys/fs/cgroup/kcs`
cgroup; `kube-run.sh`'s `metric_collector` reads its `cpu.stat`/`memory.current`
(cgroup v2). Unscheduled = the final `Queue.PendingPodsNum` from the JSON metrics
log (pods that never left the queue).

## Usage

```sh
# duration = simulated seconds each pod runs (default 60); override with KCS_DURATION
./kube-run.sh -m kcs -e ./data/small/vanilla -n 1 -o ./results/kcs.csv
```

Opt-in (not in the default `SIM_MODULES`): needs the binary built. `kube-director.sh`
maps `kcs` to the `vanilla/` data path, so it can be added to a custom `SIM_MODULES`.

## Verified results

`data/small/vanilla` = 100 nodes / **1067 pods**, container on Docker-Desktop/WSL2 (cgroup v2):

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| pods | 1067 |
| unscheduled (final pending) | **0** |
| wall time | ~0.5 s |
| cpu | 0.53 s |
| memory peak (`memory.peak`) | **30.4 MB** |

Note: like the other pure simulators, kcs finishes faster than `kube-run.sh`'s
1 s `memory.current` sampling, so the harness CSV under-reports memory as
`0.00 GB`; `/sys/fs/cgroup/kcs/memory.peak` gives the real ~30 MB.
